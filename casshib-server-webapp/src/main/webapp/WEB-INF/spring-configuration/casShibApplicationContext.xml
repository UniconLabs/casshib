    	This defines a seperate core central authentication service bean
    	that CASShib will use.  The purpose of starting up a separate core
    	is to keep the "regular CAS" tickets separate from the "CASShib"
    	tickets, otherwise someone might be able to bypass security
    	mechanisms on the CASShib side by validating a ticket with the
    	"regular CAS" validators instead of the CASShib validators they
    	should be using.
