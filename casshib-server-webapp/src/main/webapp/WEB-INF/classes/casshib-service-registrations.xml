  <!-- id is the URL that CAS will redirect to after a login.  i.e., it is
       the application's "home page." id must match the serviceId parameter
       that CAS clients pass in via the query string when redirecting to the
       login page or making validation requests.
       
       appname and passcode are what get embedded in the URL when a client
       makes requests to CASShib.
       
       If appname is 'app1' and passcode is '96306' then the CAS client will
       be configured to use URLs something like:
       https://mycasshibserver.edu/casshib/shib/app1/login
       https://mycasshibserver.edu/casshib/shib/96306/serviceValidate
 -->
  <!--
  <service id="https://app1.ucmerced.edu/"
           appname="app1"
           passcode="96306" />
  -->
